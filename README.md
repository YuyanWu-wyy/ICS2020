LAB LIST:
1、Write a program in LC-3 machine language that rotates a given value of 16-bits by 2 bits to the left.
2、Write a program in LC-3 and RISCV assembly language that is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive numbers.
3、Write a program in LC-3 and RISCV assembly language that sorts a linked list of 2’s complement integers in ascending order.
4、Write a program in LC-3 and RISCV assembly language that simulates the game of NIM.(Nim is a simple two-player game. There are many variations of this game with respect to the type of counters used (stones, matches, apples, etc.), the number of counters in each row, and the number of rows in the game board.
5、Finish the given LC-3 assembly language program to realize the function of interrupt mechanism.
6、Finish 2-5 in C.
EXTRA TASK:
Write a program to implement the function of LC-3 assembler.
